Binary Tree Guessing Game:
Creator: Josh Collins
Course: Data Structures, Clark University

This game is set up like 20 questions, however if the user wants the game can go 
as long as the answer is not adequately guessed with proper questions.
The user has the ability to make the questions related to the answer either as complex or vague as possible,
so test out the ability fo the computer.

This uses the Question, QuestionNode, and QuestionTree classes.

Creativity:
The user has the ability to either play, quit, restart, or save the file,
the restart feature completely wipes the console and lets the user start a brand new game,
this lets the user streamline the game process and not have to rerun the program.

Have fun playing the game!
